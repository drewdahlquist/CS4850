### Instructions

1. After unzipping the files `server.zip` and `client.zip` in the same working directory as `users.txt`,  you should have a directory structure like:
.
+-- src
|   +-- server
|       +-- server.py
|   +-- client
|       +-- client.py
+-- users.txt

2. From within your working directory (the same one including `users.txt` and `src`), run `python3 src/server/server.py` to start the server, and `python3 src/client/client.py` to start the client.
